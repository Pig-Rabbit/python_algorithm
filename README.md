## python_algorithm
python algorithm (structures)

Built-in Data Structures
- List: ['a', 'b', 'c']
- Tuple: ('a', 'b', 'c')
- Set: set(['a','b'])
- Dictionary: {A: ['a1','a2'], B: ['b1','b2']}

User-Defined Data Structures
- Stack: Last In First Out(LIFO) / Push & Pop
- Queue: First In First Out(FIFO) / Front & Rear / Enqueue & Dequeue
- Tree: Hierarchy 

Algorithms
1. Three main approaches to solve algorithms
- Divide et Impera (divide and conquer): Divide the problem into sub-parts and solve each one
- Dynamic Programming: Divide the problem into sub-parts and apply the result of the sub-parts into similar ones
- Greedy Algorithms: Taking the easiest step while solving a problem w/o worrying about the complexity of the future steps
2. Algorithms
- Tree Traversal Algorithm: Visiting each node exactly once
- Sorting Algorithm: Sort data in some given order
- Searching Algorithm: Seek for some elements present in a given dataset
